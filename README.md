#### Video Demo: (https://youtu.be/ZzLLBvF6L0A)

#### Description: This project investigates the relationship between atmospheric CO₂ levels and global temperature changes over time. By analyzing historical climate data, it aims to uncover trends and correlations that demonstrate the impact of rising CO₂ concentrations on Earth's climate. Using statistical methods, the project calculates the correlation between these variables and evaluates the significance of this relationship through p-values. Interactive data visualizations, including scatter plots and summaries, provide insights into how human activity influences global warming. This project highlights the importance of understanding and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change challenges.
