        This project investigates the relationship between CO₂ emissions and
        global temperature changes. By analyzing data on CO₂ levels and
        temperature variations, we aim to better understand how human activities
        impact the climate and contribute to global warming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through statistical analysis and visualizations, this research
        highlights the correlation between carbon dioxide levels in the
        atmosphere and average temperature increases over time, emphasizing the
        need for sustainable practices and policy changes to mitigate climate
        change.
